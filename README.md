## 2. Enchantments permit lottery prediction 2024
### Synopsis: 
This interactive storyboard was built by me along with my project team for our Data Visualization and Storytelling course taught by Prof. Ben Jones for the MSBA program at the University of Washington. The team was tasked to provide analytics consulting services for an adventure outfitting company in Seattle called Northwest Treks, who seeked to secure a 4 day backpacking permit into the Enchantments in 2022 to create a promotional video with their team in the pristine alpine lakes region. Based on historical data, this interactive story board gives NWT reccommendations on which zone, day and group size to choose in order to win the lottery!
